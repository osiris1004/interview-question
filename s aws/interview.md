## 1:what is aws and how is it difference from traditional hosting
aws(amazon web services) is a cloud computing platform, that provides services like:
- like computing power
- storage
- databases 
- machine learning
- analyses etc
aws alow users to scales resources up or down based on demand and pay over what they use
## 2:Explain the key components of AWS architecture
AWS architecture includes 
- region : these a are geographically separated areas 
- availability zones(AZs) : these are isolated locations within a region
- virtual private cloud (VPC) : this enables you to launch resources in a virtual network
- EC2 instances,
- S3 storage
- RDS,
- lambda
etc
## 3:what is elastics load balancing(ELB)
This auto distribute incoming application traffic across multiple server to prevent overload

## 4:difference between EC2 and Lambda
### EC2
 - it provide scalable virtual servers
 - it required manual scaling
### Lambda
- this is a serverless : Serverless computing is like renting a fully managed service instead of buying and maintaining your own server.
- it auto scales based on the number of request

## 5: what is n s3 bucket (simple storage service)
it is object storage in aws. it provide durability, scalability and can be configure for versioning and access control 

## 6:how do you secure data at rest in S3
data at rest in S3 acn be secured using server-side encryption (SSE)<br>
aws offer diffrence SSe options, including SSE-S3, ssE-KMS, ans SSE-C, each prode avrious levels of controle and security

## 7:what is a security group in aws
security group act as a firewall to control inbound and outbound traffic based on rules

## 8:auto scaling
Auto scaling automatically adjusts the number of instances in  a gouge to maintain performance

## 9:Aws cloudFormation 
is an infrastructure as code (Iac) service that allow describes what resources you need, and CloudFormation takes care of setting everything up for you.

## 10:how does aws lambdas works
lambdas works is a serverless computing service and run code in response to event and auto manages the computing resources. devs upload thier code, and lambda executes it in response to triggers like changes to data in s3 Bucket or updates to Dynamodb table

## 12:explain the use case of Amazon RDs
Amazon RDS(relational Database service) is used for managing relation databases in cloud. it support various database engine like Mysql, PostgreSql, and SQl Server. it handle database routing like backups, scaling patch management

## 13:what is the significances of VPC
VPC (virtual private cloud ) allows you to launch aws resources in to a virtual network. it provide control over the virtual networking environment, including IP address ranges, subnets, routing tables

## 14:How to we handle security in aws 
security is done by implementing IAM (IDENTITY and ACCESS Group Management), using security group, configuring network ACLs, encrypting data in transit and at rest, and regularly auditing and monitoring resource.

## 15:explain the use of aws Lambda Layers
it is the way to centrally mange code and data that is shared across multiple Lambda function
