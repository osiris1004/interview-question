## 1:what is react
react is a js library and component base approach, to create single page application.

## 2:what are the 7 key feature of react
### virtual dom
this is the virtualization of the dom which enable react to manipulate efficient the dom without touching it directly. hence improve performance.<br>
**NB** dom is the hierarchical ot tree type representation of web page which allow js to dynamically manipulate the structure and content

### component base architecture 
is the structuring of user interface inform of module or reusable component, leading to scalable and maintainable application

### reusability and component 

### jsx
syntax allow us to write html within javascript 
```
return React.createElement(
    'div',
    {className: 'App'},
    React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello'),
     React.createElement('p', null, 'Happy')
)

```

### declarative syntax

Declarative syntax focus on describing the desired result without specifying the step by step process
#### // Declarative syntax using JSX
```

function App(){
    return <h1>hello</h1>
}

```
where as imperative involves the implementation of the  step by step process before achieving the goal
#### // Imperative syntax using JSX
```
function App(){
    const element = document.createElement("h1")
    element.textContent = "Interview Happy"
    document.body.appendChild(element)
}
```

### community ans ecosystem

### react hooks
they are function to manage state and lifecycle

- very fast due to the virtual dom
- react have a large community and ecosystem

## 4:what is arrow function

## 5:how react App load and display the components in the browser

you make a request to index.html is the single page, then in side  it there is index.js the entry point, which then call the app.js that consist of the root component. in side the app.js, there is multiple component.js living in there.then display it in the browser.
